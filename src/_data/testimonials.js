    text: "Simon is an extremely fast learner and a creative thinker, who has become a highly effective part of our dev team. As one example, he has gained very quickly a deep knowledge of Red Hat Single Sign-On, and his contributions to our work with it have been innovative and substantial. He’s able to respond constructively to feedback and to self-motivate, and he’s also integrated well socially with the wider group. His ability to make connections across teams, and to work well in a highly regulated engineering environment, mean that he will be missed when his year as an undergraduate developer with us comes to an end."

      "Simon has an ability to take a **complex task** (both IT-related and non-IT) and not only turn it around extremely quickly, but also to apply a level of thought and **ingenuity** of someone **a number of years more experienced.** It's this level of **output and creativity** which made the decision to bring Simon back after a few months in his summer holiday extremely easy."

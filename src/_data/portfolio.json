Students on the course were given free rein over what they would work on as their final project, provided it was suitably complex.\n\nAt the start of the year, I'd gotten into a good sleeping routine with the help of [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me). The site tells you when to set your alarm based on what time it is currently, factoring in the time it takes the average human to get to sleep and the length of one sleep cycle. I always thought that wrapping this in web technology was slow and unresponsive. Even then, the times it gave back could not be used to directly set an alarm on your device. For this reason, I thought the unPhone would be perfect for the job.\n\nMy final product was the Snooze Clock, which allows users to use the buttons to set alarms for relative times in the future. Additionally, it was capable of being updated over the air and being configured to connect to a WiFi network in order to retrieve the time over NTP."

Taking <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, Amazon Alexa, Discord, and the web, I sought to build a means of locating the game's many Power Moons. <i>Odyssey</i> contains over 800 Power Moons hidden across the game's many sprawling Kingdoms, with some only available after the game's main story sequence is over. Each is named as a hint to their location, such as 'Under The Waterfall Basin' or 'Caught Hopping in the Cascade Kingdom'.\n\nThese made for a great library of data to collect from across the web and serve as an API, which served as my starting point. After establishing this, I went on to build an Alexa skill with handy cards in the app and filtering by the name of each Kingdom. This only took about three hours, but needed a lot of polish and refinement - especially the filter function, which came in a fair while later.\n\nThe Discord bot accessed the database in the same manner as the API and Alexa skill - I intend to explore the potential of chatbots on Discord further. A website hosted with Flask was the icing on the cake. I went on to win another prize from Amazon Web Services for my use of Alexa Skills Kit, motivating me to submit the skill to the Alexa Skills Store.\n\nIt was at this hackathon where I felt that I'd truly carried and iterated on an idea of my own, and it's a good example of where I'm most at home - exploring something new and iterating from an MVP to something much greater."

Several stats are kept track of during the sample game we created for it, which simulates GreatUniHack2016 itself, and these are displayed in real time by way of meters on a web page. In theory, this concept cannot be widely easily replicated, but for the sake of that single situation it was an effective option to add."

To remedy this, it was suggested that we look into APIs, which brought up a variety of sources we could use: GitHub, Twitter, and DevPost, for example.\n\nIn the end, we came out with HackerTracker - intended to be an easy means of journalling the experience of a hackathon, using GitHub and Twitter input as landmarks.

I thought that GitHub's organisation support, and teams within those, had strong potential but weren't very front-facing to consumers.\n\nInspired by 'meet the team' sections in some startups' sites, we decided to work on using GitHub to retrieve HackSheffield committee members' profiles in one smooth query with GraphQL. This made the information more easy to maintain using GitHub itself. The project gives the added benefit of decentralising the site's data to those who really should have control over it - the profiles visible there reflect the latest data they have made available on GitHub. We brought this live at [mygit.club](http://mygit.club). I have since made my first pull request to [hack.sheffield.ac.uk](https://hack.sheffield.ac.uk) with the intent of porting it across and learned lots about Node.js in the process."

This, like ka-bomb.com before it, would be a MMO reinterpretation of a video game I had recently picked up. This was Stikbold, a charming Danish dodgeball game that is extremely easy to pick up and play.\n\nWe sought to use socket.io to buy us extra time to think about the game's core mechanics and how that would translate to socket server infrastructure. With Katie and Hamish working on assets and collisions, I worked with Greg on getting the business logic solidified. This resulted in a game that worked relatively well at its core, much like ka-bomb.com, but felt a lot more polished—and, best of all, was genuinely fun for all to play, including the developers who'd burned 24 hours on it!\n\nWorking on the project helped me consider the finer points of using sockets and gave me some further confidence in game development. Though I'm currently strongly of the mindset that I intend to develop software, ShefBall has left game development on the table as an option. It's also introduced me to socket servers properly and secured our team a prize thanks to Craneware."
